This is a Phishing tool. Phishing is a type of hacking also called credential harvesting. It creates fake websites for victims to login which saves their login info which includes IP, User-Agent, Username and Password to a file in the computer running Blackeye. This tool has been there for [Linux](https://www.linux.org/) and even [Android](https://www.android.com/) via [Termux](https://termux.com/). I converted it to [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-in/windows).
